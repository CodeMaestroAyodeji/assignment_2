### GitHub Repository
You can find a sample project initialized with Git and necessary configuration files (Index.html, Style.css, README.md, .gitignore) in my GitHub repository: [My Sample Repo](https://codemaestroayodeji.github.io/plp_sample_repo/)

### Challenges Faced During Installation
**1. Internet Data Usage:** The installations required a significant amount of internet data, which was a challenge. <br>
